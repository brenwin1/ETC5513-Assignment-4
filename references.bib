              Intersections of Race, Class and Gender In Encounters with the

  author   = "Dottolo, Andrea L and Stewart, Abigail J",
  abstract = "Middle-aged black and white graduates of a Midwestern US high
              school responded to interview questions about race and racial
              identity. Their answers included descriptions of police
              harassment and crime, and focused on those considered to be
              criminal actors: most often apparently poor, black men.
              Qualitative analysis of 38 interviews showed that questions about
              racial identity tapped into a discourse that constructs and
              stereotypes criminals as occupying social positions defined by
              race, class and gender, particularly for African Americans. The
              concept of intersectionality illuminates the cultural
              construction of police encounters with citizens in terms of poor
              black men, and the specific nature of the stories of racial
              identity told---and not told---by respondents with different
              race, class and gender identities.",
